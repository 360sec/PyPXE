#To Do

- [ ] Add ```--debug``` prints to dhcp/tftp/http (such as 404, Offer/ACKs w/ filename)
- [ ] Implement [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines across entire project. (Missing: 4 space indent, we have 3)
- [ ] Turn longer functions to kwargs vs positional
- [ ] Remove hard-coded ```/24``` in dhcpd
